Hi, I'm @w1zarddddd
- I am currently working on projects related to data analysis, machine learning, and AR/VR applications.
- I want to collaborate on open source projects in Python, Data Science, and the Unity AR Foundation.
- I need help learning about real-time data processing systems and fraud prevention.
- I am currently studying advanced ML techniques, Big Data processing tools (Spark), and improving my augmented reality development skills.
- Ask me about Python, data preprocessing, feature development, Unity AR Foundation, and prototyping AR/VR.
